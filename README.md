Agriculture is most important economic and employment sector. The most prevalent problem faced by farmers is that they do not select the appropriate crop for their soil. They will experience a significant drop in production as a result of this. Precision agriculture has been used to solve the farmers' difficulty. Precision agriculture is all the rage these days.
